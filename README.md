I designed an application that will take a user’s input and compare it to famous people in history, the application is designed to be fun, interactive, and easy to use. The purpose of this application is to take the users age as input and compare them to different people in history when they passed away. The application is designed make learning fun for students and everyone else who is interested in learning about history, the application will make students or anyone who uses it to see what famous people from history were doing around their ages what they accomplished in life, the paths they took to get to that point in their lives, what inspired them and what they did to impact the lives of people and the environment around them.

the application will intrigue both normal and curious students or users and encourage them in wanting to learn more about history. By using technology, the application will show the students and users of different ages relatable stories about historical figures and showing them to a rich history. the application will be for everyone who is interested in history even if the user is a student or someone who wants learn and uncover the stories about the history of historical figures, the application will hopefully encourage learning and takes the user on a journey through history.

The application will encourage learning for people want to know more about history, the application will help the user to compare their ages with famous people in history. The application will also help bridge the gap between past and present, bringing history closer to the fingertips of the user and accessible to the audience who are eager to learn. The application will help the user gain knowledge about the historical figures around their ages.

The application hopes to take user on a journey through history bringing them closer to famous historical figures and possibly inspiring them to per sue their studies further.it tells the stories of historical figures bringing them to the user’s phone.

I used android studio to design the user interface, the theme of the application is designed to be stylish with colors that correspond with each other. from elegant typography to thoughtful use of spaces, every element of the user interface has been thoughtfully designed to enhance the user experience and facilitate effortless interaction. It’s designed to make it easier to use and easier on the eyes so that the user is intrigued by the app. I used headings and subheadings inside the application to also tell the user what the application does. The application is designed to be interactive and responsive so that the user finds it easier to use.
Furthermore, the user interface design includes a comprehensive user experience strategy. By incorporating interactive elements and intuitive gestures, the user interface promotes a sense of involvement, turning passive users into active participants in the learning process. Whether touching timelines, touching interactive elements, or exploring multimedia content, users are encouraged to delve into the stories of historical figures and discover hidden gems of history.
Using the right colors to go with the app figuring out what works and what does was part of the design. First, I had to figure out what the user interface will look like, planning to write pseudocode and drawing flowcharts and using programming logic on how I was going to build the application. Using programming logic and following syntax rules to design the application for the user. after working out the details of how the app was going to look like I made a list of steps I was going to take and from there I followed the steps to build the application using different sources and researching how to implement different codes making sure they work, debugging the application so that it works without issues.
I researched the information of famous historical figures that I was going to use on my application. I used when statement to show the information when the user enters their age.


Using android studio to develop the application was easy as the android studio platform was user friendly and developing and the platform also offers GitHub and other user integrated development systems to make it easier for developers to use the platform from beginners to professionals. 

. GitHub and GitHub Actions

throughout the process of app building I used GitHub to make the process, I used GitHub to version control and to ensure that my code is reliable and that it had no errors. Using GitHub I created a repository where all my updates of the code were committed and updated, tracked.it allowed me to create separate files to test out new features or fix bugs without changing the code and risking everything falling apart. Then, once I was confident everything was good to go, I could merge my changes back into the main code.


. testing and automated testing

I conducted manual testing as I was making changes to my code to make sure the application will work the way it is intended to. The testing was to make sure that the application works seamlessly and offers enjoyable educational experience for students. testing was utilized so that the application will run without any problems so that the user gets a finished product that runs without any errors.
The version control from GitHub Actions has been an important tool for making the development processes easier. By making the workflows and triggers, I used automated tasks on my code and deployment, testing and reducing the work that was going to be used manually work and making development much more faster and it saved me a lot of time.it made deploying updates to my code simple and easy, GitHub Actions has helped me to work on my code and update it whenever I wanted to and making while it reliable and improving workflow.

. Using GitHub

it was helpful when I was working on my code. It helped me keep everything organized. easy save the changes I made and track them over time.
I was able to make changes to my code on the get go, I updated my changes easily. This made it easier for me and what I was working on. It let me try out new coding lines without making any changes to my code so I could avoid making unwanted errors on my code or making the code that was working previously and not work anymore due to unforeseen errors. it allowed me to create separate files to test new files and fix bugs without worrying about breaking anything. If the code was updating is working without any error, I could update my changes back into the main code anytime I wanted to. But GitHub wasn't just about coding on my own, it had some features that allowed for working with my classmates. It also allowed us to talk about our projects, give each other feedback on our code, and keep track of any problems we encountered. It really helped us work together more effectively. It made everything way easier to handle and improved how well I could work with my friends.
